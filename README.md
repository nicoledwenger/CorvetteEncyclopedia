<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Corvette Encyclopedia Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project was created as a course assignment in CGT 353 in which we had to build an interactive and dynamic site of our choice. As a budding car enthusiast, I was inspired to create a site that balanced design and technical information without being too overwhelming. 

My overall objective was to create a different take on traditional wiki sites. When researching the different generations of Corvettes, it was overwhelming how much text was presented. Often images were very small and the sites appeared dull and out of date. Therefore, I wanted to have a more modern appearance.

### Built With
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project can be used as an outline for other similar wiki pages. Later on, this site will be expanded into an application utilizing API data.
